"""
This code assumes that you have already trained a neural network model using TensorFlow and have saved it to a file. 
You will need to replace 'path/to/model' with the actual path to your saved model file.

The API route is defined as '/predict', which expects a JSON object with an array of input data. 
The input data is converted to a numpy array, and the model makes a prediction on this input. 
The prediction is then returned as a JSON response.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.
