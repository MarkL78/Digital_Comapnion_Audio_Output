"""
This code assumes that you have already installed the whisper library and have a whisper function that takes a 
string as input and returns a modified version of the string (e.g., replacing all letters with lowercase and 
adding a "shh" at the end).

The API route is defined as '/whisper', which expects a JSON object with a text property containing the 
input string. The whisper function is called with the input string, and the result is returned as a JSON response.

Note that this is just a starting point, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.
